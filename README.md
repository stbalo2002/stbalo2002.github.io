This is the project report for the practical machine learning course in the Data Science Specialization offered by the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Medicine.  
The course focuses of using algorithm to train `R` to be able to predict the outcome of a given data entry using data with known outcomes. 

The project consists of two datasets - the pml-training and the pml-testing. The pml-training is to be used for building the algorithm and the pml-testing for 
prediction. 

#  Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. 
These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, 
to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, 
but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 
participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.
