## Population with HIV

Declines in new HIV infections among adults have slowed alarmingly in recent years, 
with the estimated annual number of new infections among adults remaining nearly 
static at about 1.9 million [1.7 million–2.2 million] in 2015.

Estimated new HIV infections by county, Kenya, 2014
Key locations within countries
Complex and varied social, structural and economic dynamics within countries 
account for the uneven geographical distribution of HIV. In many countries, HIV 
prevalence is higher in cities, where the vibrancy, stress and anonymity of urban 
life, and its bustle of encounters and interactions, provide increased opportunities 
for behaviours and sexual networking that may increase the risk of HIV infection. 
Increased efforts to collect and analyse subnational data are revealing where HIV 
infections are occurring and where there are gaps in the provision of HIV services. 
In Kenya, for example, an analysis in 2014 found that 65% of new HIV infections 
occurred in just 9 of the country’s 47 counties (1).

Ignorance and misunderstanding continue to undermine efforts to end AIDS. In 
the worst cases, discriminatory attitudes and behaviour are facilitated by punitive 
laws and policies. In 2016, 72 countries had laws allowing specifically for HIV 
criminalization. Between 1 April 2013 and 30 September 2015, four countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa passed new HIV criminalization laws: Botswana, Côte d’Ivoire, 
Nigeria and Uganda 



## Conclusion

### Trends in Child Mortalities in Nigeria {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}


Scale-up of antiretroviral therapy is on a Fast-Track trajectory that has 
surpassed expectations. Global coverage of antiretroviral therapy reached 46% 
[43–50%] at the end of 2015. Gains were greatest in the world’s most affected 
region, eastern and southern Africa. Coverage increased from 24% [22–25%] in 
2010 to 54% [50–58%] in 2015, reaching a regional total of 10.3 million people. 

The gains in treatment are largely responsible for a 26% decline in AIDS-related 
deaths globally since 2010, from an estimated 1.5 million [1.3 million–1.7 million] in 2010 to 1.1 million [940 000 –1.3 million] in 2015

The gender gap for treatment among adults highlights the impact of gender norms 
that delay initiation of treatment among men, reduce treatment adherence, blunt the 
preventive effects of treatment, and lead to men accounting for 58% of adult AIDS-
related deaths.

The progress made in reaching people with HIV treatment and in reducing AIDS-
related deaths demonstrates the effectiveness of a Fast-Track approach. These 
AIDS-response successes show that exceptional results can be achieved when 
there is broad leadership and consistent financial commitment.
The job is still only half done, however. Approximately 54% [50–57%] of people 
living with HIV are in need of treatment, many of whom do not know their 
HIV status. A growing number of countries have committed to achieving the 
90–90–90 treatment target by 2020. This coalition of the brave needs to expand 
to a global commitment, and that commitment must translate quickly into even 
greater innovation and investment. 
A similar foundation of vision and leadership is required to reinvigorate HIV 
prevention. An array of effective HIV prevention tools is available, including 
condoms, harm reduction, voluntary medical male circumcision, pre-exposure 
prophylaxis, cash transfers for girls and structural approaches that promote 
gender equality and access to secondary education. Community- and peer-based 
approaches to sharing prevention tools are proven effective. The key is to combine these tools into combination HIV prevention packages 
that address the specific needs of populations that are being left behind, and 
to establish enabling environments that allow these populations to access 
HIV, health and social services without fear of violence, arrest or persecution. 
Specific targets on reaching the people at greatest need of these packages are 
urgently required.
