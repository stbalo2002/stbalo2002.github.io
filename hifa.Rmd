Since the beginning of the 21st century, Nigeria has had at least 5 epidemics of Cerebrospinal Meningitis with the [current epidemic](http://ncdc.gov.ng/themes/common/files/sitreps/a17570e67be37920ea500a7af0743eea.pdf) recording a total of 9, 646 suspected cases and 839 deaths as at 22nd April 2017. Defective health information both on the part of [political office holders](http://www.vanguardngr.com/2017/04/god-sent-type-c-meningitis-punish-nigerians-sins-gov-yari/) and the [public](http://breaking.com.ng/nigeria/meningitis-not-caused-by-witches-doctor-tells-rural-dwellers/) has largely contributed to this recurrent epidemic and many of the other epidemics plaguing the country. 

The concept of *"Health For All in the 21st  century"* cannot be achieved if appropriate, adequate and timely information is not brought to the reach of both the health workers and the general public. **HIFA** aims to achieve this thus promoting preventive health measures, and timely health seeking behaviour. 

[Health Information For All (**HIFA**)](http://www.hifa.org) was developed and launched by the Global Health Information Network in Mombasa, Kenya in October 2006, at the 10th Congress of the Association for Health Information and Libraries in Africa. **R4HDS** is using its platform to promote the HIFA vision:

<p><i>"A world where every person and every health worker will have access to the       healthcare information they need to protect their own health and the health      of others."</i></p>

**HIFA** is a global network of health professionals, publishers, librarians, technologists, researchers and policymakers. It is supported by over 280 health and development organizations worldwide, and currently has over 16 000 members spread across 175 countries with a-third of them in Africa. It operates on different platforms (forums):
